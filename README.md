# INSIGHT2_PRAGATI
Project PRAGATI uses AI (YOLOv8) to analyze live traffic from camera feeds. It calculates a "Priority Score" for each road based on vehicle density and type. This score dynamically controls traffic lights, prioritizing congested roads to reduce wait times and improve overall flow, creating smarter urban mobility.
